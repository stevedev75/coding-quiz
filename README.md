# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Application to generate a five-question, multiple-choice quiz about some basic JavaScript concepts.

My motivation for this project was to create a web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch, with the bulk of the coding done in JavaScript to “inject” dynamic content into the HTML and providing a good user experience. 

I built this project, in part, to showcase my understanding of JavaScript and how it interacts with HTML through the DOM.

This application solves the problem often of how to build an application from scratch that uses multiple kinds of files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) which interact with one another to provide a seamless user experience.

In this project, I learned a tremendous amount of information about JavaScript including setting up variables, and using event listeners and things like innerHTML and querySelectors.
